career-profile:
  title: About
  summary: |
    I'm an embedded software engineer with experience building real-time, multi-threaded systems in C++ and Python. At MITRE, I developed a configurable GNSS/GPS receiver for the NTS-3 satellite program and worked on next-gen GPS technologies. My background also includes research in medical imaging and sensor systems, with published work on an implantable cancer sensor and optical imaging. I hold a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern and enjoy building systems that blend hardware, software, and signal processing.
